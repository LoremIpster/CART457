Hello and welcome to Doors Pro

First of all, create a folder called 'Editor Default Resources' and put it directly under
the Assets root folder. So this would be Assets/Editor Default Resources.
Find the folder 'Icons' under Assets/Ameye/DoorsPro/Icons and move that folder into the Editor Default Resources folder.
Re-start Unity.

You can find a quick start guide under Assets/Ameye/DoorsPro/Support. 
For the documentation, click on Tools>DoorsPro>Support>Online Documentation
